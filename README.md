This repo applies design-first principles to the design of the Pakyow Web Framework. The `master` branch contains a complete app that demonstrates how every feature of the framework is used. It includes features that are currently implemented as well as features that are scheduled to be introduced in the next major release.

Think of this project like a spec demonstrating how each and every framework feature will be used by an end-user. It lets us see how features work together to create the best possible developer experience. Features and changes that will have an end-user impact are proposed and discussed here first.

When the next major release drops, `master` will be bootable and fully usable.

# About Design-First

Design-First is a philosophy of design that prioritizes the end-user experience over implementation. It suggests that good design happens when you start with what the user sees and interacts with. For Pakyow, design-first means we prioritize how a developer uses the framework over how the framework works internally.

Both are ultimately important, but a proper implementation will naturally follow good design.
