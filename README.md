This repo applies design-first principles to the Pakyow Web Framework. The `master` branch contains a complete app that demonstrates how core features of the framework are used. It uses features that are currently implemented as well as features that are scheduled to be introduced in the next release. When the next release drops, `master` should be fully usable.

You can think of it as a living spec. Changes that impact how the framework is used are proposed here first. Seeing changes in context of a real app helps us discover hidden details and ensure a positive developer experience.

# About Design-First

Design-First prioritizes the end-user experience over implementation details. This is a core principle that informs many aspects of the project. For Pakyow itself, design-first means we prioritize how a person uses the framework over how the framework works internally. Both are important, but we believe that proper implementation naturally follows great design.
